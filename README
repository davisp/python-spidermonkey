===================
Python-Spidermonkey
===================

This Python module allows for the implementation of Javascript?
classes, objects and functions in Python, as well as the evaluation
and calling of Javascript scripts and functions. It borrows heavily
from Claes Jacobssen's ``Javascript`` Perl module, which in turn is
based on Mozilla's ``PerlConnect`` Perl binding.

This code was originally written by John J. Lee in 2003.  After being
unmaintained for a number of years, it was subsequently picked up by
Atul Varma in 2008.

Tutorial
========

The first thing you'll want to do is create a ``Runtime`` instance,
which encapsulates a ``JSRuntime`` object from Spidermonkey.  From the
`JSAPI User Guide`_:

  A ``JSRuntime``, or *runtime*, is the space in which the Javascript
  variables, objects, scripts, and contexts used by your application
  are allocated. Every ``JSContext`` and every object in an
  application lives within a ``JSRuntime``. They cannot travel to
  other runtimes or be shared across runtimes. Most applications only
  need one runtime.

Creating the ``Runtime`` instance is straightforward:

  >>> from spidermonkey import Runtime
  >>> rt = Runtime()

You'll then want to use the ``Runtime`` to create a ``Context``
instance, which encapsulates a ``JSContext`` object from Spidermonkey.
From the JSAPI User Guide:

  A ``JSContext``, or *context*, is like a little machine that can do
  many things involving Javascript code and objects. It can compile
  and execute scripts, get and set object properties, call Javascript
  functions, convert Javascript data from one type to another, create
  objects, and so on.

In Firefox, for instance, a different context is used for each webpage
you view.  A separate context is even created for each physical
browser window, because much of Firefox's functionality is actually
written in Javascript.  Contexts can have their own security
policies associated with them, and objects can be shared between
multiple contexts.

Creating a context in Python-Spidermonkey is done like so:

  >>> cx = rt.new_context()

Now that you've got a context, you can do lots of things, like
evaluating arbitrary Javascript expressions and using their results in
Python code:

  >>> cx.eval_script("1 + 2") + 3
  6

We can create classes in Python and access them in Javascript, too:

  >>> class Foo:
  ...   def hello(self):
  ...     print "Hello, Javascript world!"
  >>> cx.bind_class(Foo, bind_constructor=True)
  >>> cx.eval_script("var f = new Foo(); f.hello();")
  Hello, Javascript world!

We can also get back objects from Javascript and use them:

  >>> f = cx.eval_script("f;")
  >>> f.hello()
  Hello, Javascript world!

Limitations
===========

The module currently has a number of features that still need to be
implemented.  For instance, it's not yet possible to call a function
defined in Javascript:

  >>> cx.eval_script("function foo(x) { return x + 1; }; foo;")
  {'prototype': {}}

Errors in Javascript code also don't produce particularly helpful
tracebacks:

  >>> cx.eval_script("3 + undefinedVariable")
  Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
  JSError: can't evaluate Javascript script

Installation
============

Note that at present, installation has only been tested on OS X and
64-bit Ubuntu Linux; support for Windows is forthcoming.

At present, you'll need a C compiler on your system to install this
extension, as well as the `Pyrex`_ package.

* Check out the Python-Spidermonkey module from the `SVN repository`_.

* From the root of your checkout, run::

    python setup.py build

  Don't worry about the compiler warnings.  Then, with appropriate
  permissions, run::

    python setup.py install

Testing
=======

The module has a test suite.  Just run::

  python test.py

Note that one of the tests currently prints out a Javascript error
message.  This isn't a test failure (though it is a `bug`_).

for all his Mozilla work), and to Erwin on the freenode ``#c`` IRC
channel for gdb tips.
